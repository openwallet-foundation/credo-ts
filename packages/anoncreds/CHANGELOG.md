# Changelog

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 879ed2c: deprecate node 18
- 297d209: - Rely on Uint8Array instead of Buffer for internal key bytes representation
  - Remove dependency on external Big Number libraries
  - Default to use of uncompressed keys for Secp256k1, Secp256r1, Secp384r1 and Secp521r1
- b5fc7a6: - All `didcomm` package modules, APIs, models and services that are used for dependency injection now are prefixed with `DidComm` in its naming
  - DIDComm-related events have also changed their text string to make it possible to distinguish them from events triggered by other protocols
  - DIDComm credentials module API has been updated to use the term `credentialExchangeRecord` instead of `credentialRecord`, since it is usually confused with W3cCredentialRecords (and potentially other kind of credential records we might have). I took this opportunity to also update `declineOffer` options structure to match DIDComm proofs module API
  - DIDComm-related records were renamed, but their type is still the original one (e.g. `CredentialRecord`, `BasicMessageRecord`). Probably it's worth to take this major release to do the migration, but I'm afraid that it will be a bit risky, so I'm hesitating to do so or leaving it for some other major upgrade (if we think it's actually needed)
- e936068: when signing in Credo, it is now required to always reference a key id. For DIDs this is extracted from the DidRecord, and for JWKs (e.g. in holder binding) this is extracted form the `kid` of the JWK. For X509 certificates you need to make sure there is a key id attached to the certificate manually for now, since we don't have a X509 record like we have a DidRecord. For x509 certificates created before 0.6 you can use the legacy key id (`certificate.keyId = certificate.publicJwk.legacyKeyId`), for certificates created after 0.6 you need to manually store the key id and set it on the certificate after decoding.

  For this reason, we now require instances of X509 certificates where we used to require encoded certificates, to allow you to set the keyId on the certificate beforehand.

- 9f78a6e: upgrade anoncreds wrapper to 0.3
- e936068: The `Key` and `Jwk` classes have been removed in favour of a new `PublicJwk` class, and all APIs in Credo have been updated to use the new `PublicJwk` class. Leveraging Jwk as the base for all APIs provides more flexility and makes it easier to support key types where it's not always so easy to extract the raw public key bytes. In addition all the previous Jwk relatedfunctionality has been replaced with the new KMS jwk functionalty. For example `JwaSignatureAlgorithm` is now `Kms.KnownJwaSignatureAlgorithms`.
- e936068: The wallet API has been completely rewritten to be more generic, support multiple backends at the same time, support generic encrypting and decryption, support symmetric keys, and enable backends that use key ids rather than the public key to identify a key. This has resulted in significant breaking changes, and all usages of the wallet api should be updated to use the new `agent.kms` APIs. In addition the wallet is not available anymore on the agentContext. If you used this, instead inject the KMS API using `agentContext.resolve(Kms.KeyManagementApi)`.
- 9df09fa: - messagehandler should return undefined if it doesn't want to response with a message
- 70c849d: update target for tsc compiler to ES2020. Generally this should not have an impact for the supported environments (Node.JS / React Native). However this will have to be tested in React Native
- 897c834: DIDComm has been extracted out of the Core. This means that now all DIDComm related modules (e.g. proofs, credentials) must be explicitly added when creating an `Agent` instance. Therefore, their API will be accesable under `agent.modules.[moduleAPI]` instead of `agent.[moduleAPI]`. Some `Agent` DIDComm-related properties and methods where also moved to the API of a new DIDComm module (e.g. `agent.registerInboundTransport` turned into `agent.didcomm.registerInboundTransport`).

  **Example of DIDComm Agent**

  Previously:

  ```ts
       const config = {
        label: name,
        endpoints: ['https://myendpoint'],
        walletConfig: {
          id: name,
          key: name,
        },
      } satisfies InitConfig

      const agent = new Agent({
        config,
        dependencies: agentDependencies,
        modules: {
          connections: new DidCommConnectionsModule({
             autoAcceptConnections: true,
          })
        })
      this.agent.registerInboundTransport(new DidCommHttpInboundTransport({ port }))
      this.agent.registerOutboundTransport(new HttpOutboundTransport())

  ```

  Now:

  ```ts
       const config = {
        label: name,
        walletConfig: {
          id: name,
          key: name,
        },
      } satisfies InitConfig

      const agent = new Agent({
        config,
        dependencies: agentDependencies,
        modules: {
          ...getDefaultDidcommModules({ endpoints: ['https://myendpoint'] }),
          connections: new DidCommConnectionsModule({
             autoAcceptConnections: true,
          })
        })
      agent.didcomm.registerInboundTransport(new DidCommHttpInboundTransport({ port }))
      agent.didcomm.registerOutboundTransport(new DidCommHttpOutboundTransport())
  ```

- 81e3571: BREAKING CHANGE:

  `label` and `connectionImageUrl` have been dropped from Agent configuration. Therefore, it must be specified manually in all DIDComm connection establishment related methods. If you don't want to specify any label, just use an empty value.

  In the particular case of mediation provisioning through a `mediatorInvitationUrl`, the label will be always set to an empty value ('').

- bc6f0c7: Add support for both CJS and ESM module syntax.

  - Use `tsdown` to bundle for both CJS and ESM (bridge period) -> tsdown is based on rust, so it should help with performance
  - Update to `vitest` since jest doesn't work well with ESM -> this should also help with performance
  - Simplify type checking -> just a single type check script instead of one for all packages. This should help with performance.

### Patch Changes

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Agent-produced files will now be divided in different system paths depending on their nature: data, temp and cache. Previously, they were located at a single location, defaulting to a temporary directory.

If you specified a custom path in `FileSystem` object constructor, you now must provide an object containing `baseDataPath`, `baseTempPath` and `baseCachePath`. They can point to the same path, although it's recommended to specify different path to avoid future file clashes.
