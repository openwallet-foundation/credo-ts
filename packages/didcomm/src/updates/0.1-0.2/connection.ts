 * With the addition of the out of band protocol, invitations are now stored in the {@link OutOfBandRecord}. In addition a new field `invitationDid` is added to the connection record that
 * is generated based on the invitation service or did. This allows to reuse existing connections.
 *
 * This migration method extracts the invitation and other relevant data into a separate {@link OutOfBandRecord}. By doing so it converts the old connection protocol invitation into the new
 * Out of band invitation message. Based on the service or did of the invitation, the `invitationDid` is populated.
 *
 * Previously when creating a multi use invitation, a connection record would be created with the `multiUseInvitation` set to true. The connection record would always be in state `invited`.
 * If a request for the multi use invitation came in, a new connection record would be created. With the addition of the out of band module, no connection records are created until a request
 * is received. So for multi use invitation this means that the connection record with multiUseInvitation=true will be deleted, and instead all connections created using that out of band invitation
 * will contain the `outOfBandId` of the multi use invitation.
