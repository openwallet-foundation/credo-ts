### BREAKING CHANGES

- Agent-produced files will now be divided in different system paths depending on their nature: data, temp and cache. Previously, they were located at a single location, defaulting to a temporary directory.

If you specified a custom path in `FileSystem` object constructor, you now must provide an object containing `baseDataPath`, `baseTempPath` and `baseCachePath`. They can point to the same path, although it's recommended to specify different path to avoid future file clashes.
