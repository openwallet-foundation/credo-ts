   * Validate a chain of X.509 certificates according to RFC 5280
   *
   * This function requires a list of base64 encoded certificates and, optionally, a certificate that should be found in the chain.
   * If no certificate is provided, it will just assume the leaf certificate
   *
   * The leaf certificate should be the 0th index and the root the last
   *
   * The Issuer of the certificate is found with the following algorithm:
   * - Check if there is an AuthorityKeyIdentifierExtension
   * - Go through all the other certificates and see if the SubjectKeyIdentifier is equal to thje AuthorityKeyIdentifier
   * - If they are equal, the certificate is verified and returned as the issuer
   *
   * Additional validation:
   *   - Make sure atleast a single certificate is in the chain
   *   - Check whether a certificate in the chain matches with a trusted certificate
