### BREAKING CHANGES

- `Dispatcher.registerMessageHandler` has been removed in favour of `MessageHandlerRegistry.registerMessageHandler`. If you want to register message handlers in an extension module, you can use directly `agentContext.dependencyManager.registerMessageHandlers`.

Signed-off-by: Ariel Gentile <gentilester@gmail.com>

- Agent default outbound content type has been changed to DIDComm V1. If you want to use former behaviour, you can do it so by manually setting `didcommMimeType` in `Agent`'s init config:

```
  const agent = new Agent({ config: {
     ...
     didCommMimeType: DidCommMimeType.V0
  }, ...  })
```

- Agent-produced files will now be divided in different system paths depending on their nature: data, temp and cache. Previously, they were located at a single location, defaulting to a temporary directory.

If you specified a custom path in `FileSystem` object constructor, you now must provide an object containing `baseDataPath`, `baseTempPath` and `baseCachePath`. They can point to the same path, although it's recommended to specify different path to avoid future file clashes.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Handler has been renamed to MessageHandler to be more descriptive, along with related types and methods. This means:

Handler is now MessageHandler
HandlerInboundMessage is now MessageHandlerInboundMessage
Dispatcher.registerHandler is now Dispatcher.registerMessageHandlers

- `useDidKeyInProtocols` configuration parameter is now enabled by default. If your agent only interacts with modern agents (e.g. AFJ 0.2.5 and newer) this will not represent any issue. Otherwise it is safer to explicitly set it to `false`. However, keep in mind that we expect this setting to be deprecated in the future, so we encourage you to update all your agents to use did:key.
- action-menu module has been removed from the core and moved to a separate package. To integrate it in an Agent instance, it can be injected in constructor like this:

```ts
const agent = new Agent({
  config: {
    /* config */
  },
  dependencies: agentDependencies,
  modules: {
    actionMenu: new ActionMenuModule(),
    /* other custom modules */
  },
})
```

Then, module API can be accessed in `agent.modules.actionMenu`.

- question-answer module has been removed from the core and moved to a separate package. To integrate it in an Agent instance, it can be injected in constructor like this:

```ts
const agent = new Agent({
  config: {
    /* config */
  },
  dependencies: agentDependencies,
  modules: {
    questionAnswer: new QuestionAnswerModule(),
    /* other custom modules */
  },
})
```

Then, module API can be accessed in `agent.modules.questionAnswer`.

- custom modules have been moved to the .modules namespace. In addition the agent constructor has been updated to a single options object that contains the `config` and `dependencies` properties. Instead of constructing the agent like this:

```ts
const agent = new Agent(
  {
    /* config */
  },
  agentDependencies
)
```

You should now construct it like this:

```ts
const agent = new Agent({
  config: {
    /* config */
  },
  dependencies: agentDependencies,
})
```

This allows for the new custom modules to be defined in the agent constructor.

- - `queryFeatures` method parameters have been unified to a single `QueryFeaturesOptions` object that requires specification of Discover Features protocol to be used.

* `isProtocolSupported` has been replaced by the more general synchronous mode of `queryFeatures`, which works when `awaitDisclosures` in options is set. Instead of returning a boolean, it returns an object with matching features
* Custom modules implementing protocols must register them in Feature Registry in order to let them be discovered by other agents (this can be done in module `register(dependencyManager, featureRegistry)` method)

- All module api classes have been renamed from `XXXModule` to `XXXApi`. A module now represents a module plugin, and is separate from the API of a module. If you previously imported e.g. the `CredentialsModule` class, you should now import the `CredentialsApi` class
- To make AFJ multi-tenancy ready, all services and repositories have been made stateless. A new `AgentContext` is introduced that holds the current context, which is passed to each method call. The public API hasn't been affected, but due to the large impact of this change it is marked as breaking.

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **indy:** the transaction author agreement acceptance mechanism was previously automatically the first acceptance mechanism from the acceptance mechanism list. With this addition, the framework never automatically selects the acceptance mechanism anymore and it needs to be specified in the transactionAuthorAgreement in the indyLedgers agent config array.
- the credentials associated with a credential exchange record are now deleted by default when deleting a credential exchange record. If you only want to delete the credential exchange record and not the associated credentials, you can pass the deleteAssociatedCredentials to the deleteById method:

```ts
await agent.credentials.deleteById('credentialExchangeId', {
  deleteAssociatedCredentials: false,
})
```

- with the addition of the out of band module `credentials.createOutOfBandOffer` is renamed to `credentials.createOffer` and no longer adds the `~service` decorator to the message. You need to call `oob.createLegacyConnectionlessInvitation` afterwards to use it for AIP-1 style connectionless exchanges. See [Migrating from AFJ 0.1.0 to 0.2.x](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/blob/main/docs/migration/0.1-to-0.2.md) for detailed migration instructions.
- the connections module has been extended with an out of band module and support for the DID Exchange protocol. Some methods have been moved to the out of band module, see [Migrating from AFJ 0.1.0 to 0.2.x](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/blob/main/docs/migration/0.1-to-0.2.md) for detailed migration instructions.
- indy-sdk-react-native has been updated to 0.2.0. The new version now depends on libindy version 1.16 and requires you to update the binaries in your react-native application. See the [indy-sdk-react-native](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk-react-native) repository for instructions on how to get the latest binaries for both iOS and Android.
- The mediator pickup strategy enum value `MediatorPickupStrategy.Explicit` has been renamed to `MediatorPickupStrategy.PickUpV1` to better align with the naming of the new `MediatorPickupStrategy.PickUpV2`
- attachment method `getDataAsJson` is now located one level up. So instead of `attachment.data.getDataAsJson()` you should now call `attachment.getDataAsJson()`

# 0.1.0 (2021-12-23)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- removed the getAll() function.
- The agent’s `shutdown` method does not delete the wallet anymore. If you want to delete the wallet, you can do it via exposed wallet API.
- class-transformer released a breaking change in a patch version, causing AFJ to break. I updated to the newer version and pinned the version exactly as this is the second time this has happened now.
- internal metadata is now prefixed with \_internal to avoid clashing and accidental overwriting of internal data.
- fix(core): added \_internal/ prefix on metadata
- credentialRecord.credentialMetadata has been replaced by credentialRecord.metadata.
- a trust ping response will not be requested anymore after completing a connection. This is not required, and also non-standard behaviour. It was also causing some tests to be flaky as response messages were stil being sent after one of the agents had already shut down.
- The `ProofsModule.getRequestedCredentialsForProofRequest` expected some low level message objects as input. This is not in line with the public API of the rest of the framework and has been simplified to only require a proof record id and optionally a boolean whether the retrieved credentials should be filtered based on the proof proposal (if available).
- Proof request requestedAttributes and requestedPredicates are now a map instead of record. This is needed to have proper validation using class-validator.
- `BasicMessageReceivedEvent` has been replaced by the more general `BasicMessageStateChanged` event which triggers when a basic message is received or sent.
- Tags on a record can now be accessed using the `getTags()` method. Records should be updated with this method and return the properties from the record to include in the tags.
- extracts outbound transporter from Agent's constructor.
